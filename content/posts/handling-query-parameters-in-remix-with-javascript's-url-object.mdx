## What really is the URL object constructor?

The `URL` object constructor in javascript is used to work with URLs (unified resource locators). It provides a convenient way to parse, construct, and manipulate URLs within your code.

### Compatibility

Visit [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL)to see the browser compatibility for the URL object constructor.

### Signature

`new URL(url: string | URL, base: string | URL | undefined)`

The URL object constructor accepts a url which is a string or URL, and/or a base which is the base url which can be a string, URL, or undefined.

### More about the URL object constructor

Let's assume we are working with the following url; `https://example.com` , let's explore the different parts of the URL object constructor.

Declare a variable `myUrl` and assign `new URL("https://example.com")` to it as follows:

```javascript
const myUrl = new URL("https://example.com")
console.log(myUrl)
```

We will get the following output

```shell
URL {
  href: 'https://example.com/',
  origin: 'https://example.com',
  protocol: 'https:',
  username: '',
  password: '',
  host: 'example.com',
  hostname: 'example.com',
  port: '',
  pathname: '/',
  search: '',
  searchParams: URLSearchParams {},
  hash: ''
}
```

Let's try to breakdown each of these properties

1. **href: This is the complete URL string, including the protocol, host, pathname, search parameters, and hash.**
2. **origin:** <span>The origin is the combination of the protocol, host, and port (if specified).</span>
