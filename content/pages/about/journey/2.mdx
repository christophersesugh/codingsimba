## New Course Categories

We introduced courses in:

- **Backend Development**: Node.js, Python, Java, and database management
- **Mobile Development**: React Native, Flutter, and native app development
- **Data Science**: Python, machine learning, and data analysis
- **DevOps**: Cloud computing, Docker, and deployment strategies

## Learning Paths

We created structured learning paths that guide students from beginner to advanced levels, ensuring a smooth progression through complex topics. Each path includes:

- Interactive coding exercises
- Real-world projects
- Peer review opportunities
- Mentorship support

## Community Feedback

Our curriculum expansion was driven by community feedback and industry demands. We regularly survey our students and industry partners to ensure our content remains relevant and valuable.
