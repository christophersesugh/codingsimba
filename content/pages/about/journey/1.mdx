# The Beginning

Coding Simba was founded with a simple yet powerful mission: to make programming education accessible to everyone. What started as a personal project to help friends learn to code has grown into a comprehensive platform serving thousands of learners worldwide.

## Our Vision

We believe that programming skills should be accessible to anyone with the desire to learn, regardless of their background or circumstances. Our platform was built on the principle that quality education should be:

- **Affordable**: Breaking down financial barriers to learning
- **Accessible**: Available to anyone with an internet connection
- **Practical**: Focused on real-world applications and projects
- **Community-driven**: Built on collaboration and peer learning

## The First Steps

The journey began with a few simple tutorials and a dream to create something bigger. We started with basic web development courses and gradually expanded our curriculum to cover a wide range of programming topics.

Today, we continue to evolve and grow, always staying true to our original mission while adapting to the ever-changing landscape of technology and education.
