  # Introduction to React Hooks

  React Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components.

  ## What are Hooks?

  Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They don't work inside classes â€” they let you use React without classes.

  ## Basic Hooks

  ### useState

  The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components:

  ```jsx
  import React, { useState } from 'react';

  function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  ### useEffect

  The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in functional components:

  ```jsx
  import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  function Example() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
      document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    });

    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  ## Best Practices

  1. **Only call Hooks at the top level** - Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
  2. **Only call Hooks from React functions** - Call Hooks from React function components or custom Hooks
  3. **Use the ESLint plugin** - The `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` package helps enforce these rules

  ## Next Steps

  In the next lesson, we'll explore more advanced Hooks like `useContext`, `useReducer`, and custom Hooks.
